# 🖋️ Handwritten Equation Solver 🧠

Welcome to the **Handwritten Equation Solver**! This project uses deep learning to recognize handwritten mathematical symbols and digits. Whether it's numbers, addition, subtraction, or multiplication symbols, our model is designed to understand it all and solve equations seamlessly. 



## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize and classify handwritten mathematical symbols and digits using image processing and machine learning techniques.

### Key Features:

- 📄 **Data Preparation:** Includes extracting and processing over 4,000 images of handwritten symbols.
- 🎨 **Image Preprocessing:** Automated binarization, contour detection, and resizing to standardize images.
- 🧠 **Model Architecture:** Uses a deep CNN with layers optimized for digit and symbol recognition.
- 📊 **Evaluation:** Analyzes model accuracy using TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Handwritten Math Symbols](https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols). It includes handwritten digits (0-9) and mathematical symbols (addition, subtraction, multiplication).

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Extracts and cleans the dataset.
    - Balances the dataset by ensuring each class has a consistent number of images.

2. **Image Processing Pipeline:**
    - Converts images to grayscale and applies binarization.
    - Extracts bounding boxes for the key symbol areas.
    - Resizes images to 28x28 pixels for model input.

3. **Model Training:**
    - A CNN model with 2 convolutional layers, flattening, and dense layers.
    - Trained on normalized image data with labels for digits and symbols.

4. **Evaluation and Export:**
    - The trained model is evaluated and saved for further use.

## 📂 File Structure

- `dataset.csv`: Preprocessed image features and labels.
- `handwritten_math_symbols_model.h5`: The final trained model.
- `solver.py`: Contains the code for model training and prediction.
